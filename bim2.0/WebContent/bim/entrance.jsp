				In more advanced usage of BIM we talk about the concept of Product Models that even further improve data management and quality of the information and increases control of all processes. BIM is short for Building Information Model and as such a lot of emphasis should be put on the word information. From this central Building Information Model or product model, architects and consultants can work together, share data, check for inconsistencies, clashes and better work together. All drawings are basically an automatic output from the information model; all plans, sections & elevations are generated automatically and are kept updated all the time.
			</p>
			<p class="entrance">
				BIM models can also be used for estimations and a bill of materials can be generated. Automatic door and window schedules, as with room lists are generated. It all allows for more focus on the actual design part for the architect. 
			</p>
			<p class="entrance" style="padding-bottom:40px;">
				More and more tools allow for more advanced calculations and simulations, like sunlight and shadows, energy and carbon dioxide, airflow and sound simulations. This creates a higher demand on the OBJECTS in the model that Architects and Engineers use to populate their BIM model with. Very quickly you come to a point where manufacturers actual product specific data, is crucial to be able to generate the correct visualisation, functional analysis and accurate calculations of energy.

				The beauty of the whole BIM concept that today is used by more than 500 000 Architects all over the world is the fact that sharing an information model where all participants work in the same model means better control and understanding of design intent and constructability. 
			</p>
			<p class="entrance" style="padding-bottom:40px;">
				The 3D images work as a communication carrier and as a complement to the drawings and details that are the legal documents in the design and construction process. In the process of BIM modeling, the early phases of modeling are based on functional requirements and conceptual design. This part is covered by most CAD/BIM systems today with good generic objects, symbols (CAD) and is enough to generate 1:100 scale building approval documentation.

				BIM design tools allow for extracting different views from a building model for drawing production. All plans, sections and elevations are generated automatically from the central information model.
			</p>
			<p class="entrance">
				This also means that BIM objects that are placed into the model will hold information that is used to generate the different views. In reality it means that if an Architect uses a roof window from a specific manufacturer every drawing or visual that is generated from the BIM system will use the actual BIM object in this process. It means product placement that can show qualities and functions of the particular product and increases the way the architect can communicate and specify why certain products must be used to get the required quality and functional aspects of the design. 
			</p>
			<p class="entrance" style="padding-bottom:40px;">
				Products with good USP's (Unique Selling Propositions) will be able to prove this more often when used in the actual design and specification process. Architects can simulate and present visually why they want to choose a certain product. Every 3D view created from the BIM model will have the actual real products present. It will not only be a selection of the cheapest price anymore... BIM is changing everything!

				Most BIM modeling tools also have a very high quality rendering engine inside. It means that with today's powerful personal computer, 3D still images and animations can be done by the individual, without the need of going to an 3D expert. There are also very advanced and still easy to use rendering software that use the BIM model as a base, like Abvent Artlantis or our application for manufacturers, BIM Render. 
			</p>
			<p class="entrance">
				For the Architect to create realistic 3D images of the proposed design (which is what the owners demand today!) the work will be much better and much more realistic if the architect can work with real BIM objects and real materials and textures. A BIM object understands what materials and textures it can have and helps the Architect creating good design and realistic design intent images. At BIMobject we create both 3D models which is the base for a BIM object as well as the materials and properties of the actual real product.
			</p>
			<p class="entrance">
				It increases the realism in the images to an extent where it is hard to distinguish these from photographs.
			</p>
			<p class="entrance" style="padding-bottom:40px;">
				For manufacturers we provide a super fast and easy-to-use rendering application (BIM Render) for BIMobject and environments that is used for producing product images for catalogues and product illustrations.

		<div>
			<p class="entrance">
				The BIM model (that consists of BIM objects) is also used to calculate and to simulate various properties that helps the Architect or engineer to make better decisions or help in creating mandatory calculations for authorities.
			</p>
			<p class="entrance">
				Simulations can be sun and shadow analysis or simulations that generate energy calculations. Many BIM software tools like ArchiCAD and Revit have integrated energy calculation engines that creates energy balance schemes and gives the Architect or energy expert the amount of energy the building will consume once it is built. EcoDesigner, Ecotect and ArchiWIZARD are all examples of these calculation methods. 
			</p>
			<p class="entrance">
				These also calculate the Co2 level that the building will generate. 	
			</p>
			<p class="entrance" style="padding-bottom:40px;">
				BIM objects can all carry the necessary data to make this process faster and more accurate. Windows carry their UV value on the glazing and insulation carries its thermal capabilities. Products that assist in energy saving like solar panels and heat pumps integrate in the calculations and the designer can immediately see the energy consumption effect based on the product data in the BIM object representing the real product.

		<div class="arrow-right" ><pre class="en-title">COMMUNICATE!</pre></div>
		<div>
			<p class="entrance" style="padding-bottom:40px;">
				Communication is the essence of building design and the construction process, using BIM increases the understanding for all involved parties. Used in a correct way it increases the quality of the documentation, creates more accurate 3D images and perspective views. By using BIM and high quality BIM objects there is no need anymore to outsource work to create 3D images. It is all integrated in the BIM model and with ease and speed any number of 3D images can be generated from the BIM model. Communicating in images increases the awareness and understanding of the design intent and helps all parties understand constructability problems. Using more 3D images for communication also helps to support decision-making and comparing alternatives in functionality and costs.
